# Linear Search

A simple single class implementation of linear search in Java. The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list which they want to enter. The user then will choose a element to be searched in the list. The linear search algorithm will be automatically performed, and the index at which the target was found will be returned or the code will notify that it could not find the target. In either case, the created list will be returned as well.

## How to use it.
* Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (LinearSearch.java).
* Type 'javac LinearSearch.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line.
* Now, type 'java LinearSearch' to run your program.
* You will be able to see a output line and asking input to enter number of elements you want to enter.
* Next you will enter number of element it can be space separated or in new line.
* After completion of entering elements in list, program will be asking for element which you want to search.
* And finally you see the result in which index given element is available in list. in case of unavailable of element error message will be printed on the screen.
